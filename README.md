# Menu Plugins

Menu plugins were a feature of old garry's mod versions that allowed you to modify the main menu. 
These were removed in later garry's mod version due to (presumably) security concerns. 

This addons will readd to garry's mod - however use them at your own risk! 
Only install plugins that  you trust!

## Installation 
Simply drag and drop the lua folder into your garrysmod/garrysmod directory. 
Accept to overwrite any files. (This is required for menu plugins to function)
