# Menu Plugins

Menu plugins were a feature of old Garry's Mod versions that allowed you to modify the main menu. 
These were removed in later Garry's Mod version due to (presumably) security concerns. 

This addon will readd these plugins to Garry's Mod - however use them at your own risk! 
Only install plugins that you trust! (menu plugins have a tremendous amount of access to your pc and are sandboxed way less than normal client scripts)

## Installation 
Simply drag and drop the lua folder into your garrysmod/garrysmod directory. 
Accept to overwrite any files. (This is required for menu plugins to function)

## For developers
If you want to write your own menu plugins just look at the default plugins already included here. 
Especially take a look at the extra functionality and settings store provided.
